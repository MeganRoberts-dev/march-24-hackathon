# Testing

Return back to the [README.md](README.md) file.

Testing ensures that the site functions as expected and provides a positive user experience (UX). The site underwent rigorous testing using various automated verification methods to scrutinise the code. Additionally, thorough manual testing was conducted to identify any potential issues or bugs.

Whilst building the game, the Chrome developer Tools were used to test pages for responsiveness to different screen sizes and to troubleshoot any problems that arose, using a systematic approach to find and fix issues.
