## Intro

To celebrate World Happiness Day, The UTime app brings an opportunity for users to find their own on-screen happy place. A user can find a moment of calm by personalizing a visual and musical escape. Alternatively, they can re-energize their productivity by playing one of our happy games. Or, if it's out loud laughter they are looking for, a user can browse a hilarious selection of memes and then share that joy with their friends by email.

## Problem Statement

In a busy world with many of us working from home, it can be difficult to take time and find a true moment of happiness in our day. Studies have shown how important both laughter and moments of calm can be to alleviate some of life's stress. We therefore decided to build a platform that can provide these things to a user, right on their screen.

** Possibly opening content from webpage if this relates to the "problem" **

## Objectives

To celebrate World Happiness Day, our objective was to create a harmonious space where users could navigate to content that would provide them with happiness. This meant creating content that would appeal to people looking for different things: 
1. An online oasis - acheived through an visual and auditory experience.
2. Joy - by playing a game.
3. Laughter - from viewing amusing content.

### Target Audience

The target audience for this app is anyone looking to add happiness to their day. Although the platform is most suited to be used by adults, children could navigate all of the content safely. The app has the potential to be used for one-off happiness searches but also as part of a daily happiness or calm-finding schedule. Additionally, the soundscape feature has the potential to run in the background throughout a user's day. The universal enjoyment that comes from being happy gives this platform year-round applicability.

### User Requirements and Expectations

- Simple and intuitive user interface
- Easy to understand explanation of what the site contains
