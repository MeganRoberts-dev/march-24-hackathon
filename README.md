## Introduction

To celebrate World Happiness Day, The UTime app brings an opportunity for users to find their own on-screen happy place. A user can find a moment of calm by personalizing a visual and musical escape. Alternatively, they can re-energize their productivity by playing one of our happy games. Then, to make the world an even happier place, a user can then share their curated spaces with friends using our built in email service.

# Site Goals

## Problem Statement

In a busy world with many of us working from home, it can be difficult to take time and find a true moment of happiness in our day. Studies have shown how important both laughter and moments of calm can be to alleviate some of life's stress. We therefore decided to build a platform that can provide these things to a user, right on their screen.

** Possibly opening content from webpage if this relates to the "problem" **

## Objectives

To celebrate World Happiness Day, our objective was to create a harmonious space where users could navigate to content that would provide them with happiness. This meant creating content that would appeal to people looking for different things: 

1. An online moment of calm - achieved through a visual and auditory experience.
2. Reinvigorating energy - by playing a game with a soundtrack to match.

We then wanted a user to be able to share their happiness with others by incorporating an email service.

### Target Audience

The target audience for this app is anyone looking to add happiness to their day. Although the platform is most suited to be used by adults, children could navigate all of the content safely. The app has the potential to be used for one-off happiness searches but also as part of a daily happiness or calm-finding schedule. Additionally, the soundscape feature has the potential to run in the background throughout a user's day. The universal enjoyment that comes from being happy gives this platform year-round applicability.

### User Requirements and Expectations

- Explanation of what the site offers is easy to understand
- Scenes and sounds work as expected
- Game is intuitive and fun to play
- All content is clear and accessible
- Features and navigation work as expected
- Option to learn more about Sadness Not Found and the app
- Visually Attractive
- Option to share what a user has found via email

### User Stories

As a first time user I would like:

- To understand the different happiness areas the site offers and how to use them
- To navigate to my desired page easily
- To explore other areas of the site without having to navigate home
- To be able to choose from a selection of predefined images and sounds
- For the game to load quickly and contain smooth animations and features
- To enjoy using the site in part due to the pleasing aesthetics and affordances

As a returning user I would like:

- To be able to choose my own music to accompany my scene of choice
- To be able to find previous soundscapes to load quickly
- To play a different game to what I played last time

### Trade Offs

The following table outlines the content that should be implemented to make a functional website that appeals to users. This takes into account their expectations and the requirements for the site. Due to time constraints, some of the features that were discussed during the planning phase could not be incorporated for this project sprint (marked by N).

### Features

- **All Pages**

- All pages have a Navbar displaying the Utime logo and page title. It also includes navigation links to other pages, which condense into a burger menu on small screens.

 ![navbar](documentation/rm_images/screenshots/navbar_main.png)
 ![navbar](documentation/rm_images/screenshots/navbar_burger.png)

- Additionally, each page features a footer with links to social media sites.

- **Home Page**

 ![index.html am I responsive image](documentation/rm_images/screenshots/amiresponsive_home.png)

- The home page explains to the user what the site is about and displays the different 'happy' activities users can choose from, including Games, Soundscape, or Memes. 

- **Calm Page**

 ![calm.html am I responsive image](documentation/rm_images/screenshots/amiresponsive_calm.png)

- This page opens with the slogan 'Create a happy place.' It is a page where users can choose from a preselected sound to accompany an image of their choice (selected using the carousel of images). They can then sit back and enjoy the page, creating their own moment of calm in a busy, screen-filled day.

- The pre-loaded music options offer flexibility, allowing users to position them anywhere on the screen. Coupled with the ability to adjust their appearance using the contrast slider, users can seamlessly integrate them with the background image, minimising distractions and enhancing the visual experience. The other in built options allow a user to pause the music, change the volume or remove any music they don't want to appear on their page.

    ![screenshot of soundscape navbar](documentation/rm_images/screenshots/calm_music_moved.png)

- The navbar on this page has additional features, all of which are explained to a user when the hover over the feature. 

    - They have furhter options for controlling the music and their space. They can add new music of thier choice, stop all music, close the music setting menus and mute the music.

         ![screenshot of soundscape navbar](documentation/rm_images/screenshots/navbar_options.png)

    - Users also have the option to add a timer, allowing them to keep track of how long they have been in their personalised space. The aim is that this could become part of a users daily routine to find some time for them and just sit in a calm space for say, 5 minutes at a time. The timer play button toggles between a play, stop and reset icon to give the user control of this feature. Additionally, users have the flexibility to relocate this display to their preferred position on the screen.

The Share page facilitates users in spreading positivity from the app. Users can input their name and the recipient's email, compose a personalised message, and opt to include a Random Affirmation. Additionally, users can convey their happiness level through an emoji face, adjustable via the slider or PotLuck button.

The page transitions into an "About" section, offering a summary of the site's purpose and its design intentions. It introduces the team behind its creationâ€”404 Sadness Not Foundâ€”displayed via a slider bar. Each team member is presented with a link to their preferred contact method.

### Future Features

Due to time and skill constraints, the following features were not implemented at this time but should be considered for future rollouts:

1. Ability to search for pictures on a theme in the calm area.
2. Page to remember soundscape profiles (for quick loading on return visits)
3. To improve the email feature, we envision allowing users to easily share their personalised space. Our idea involves integrating an email form accessible on each page, pre-filled with the current page settings. Recipients would then be able to open the shared space with all the pre-loaded settings, such as the chosen image or sound. Due to skill limitations within the team this was not feasible at this time. 
4. To improve the selection of games avaiable to play

## Planning and Development

### Wireframes

Wireframes for the website were created using 

### Game Development

?????????????????????


### Emails

An [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) account was created, linked to an email provider and used to create [this](documentation/rm_images/email_template.png) email template, including the email address, sender's name, and message. Upon submission of the form, the EmailJS API sends the message using the Gmail account based on the form values created. 

### Agile Methodology

Agile devlopment techniques were implemented throughout this project. A GitHub Kanban board was utilised to keep a track of different tasks and asign them to different people. The board can be viewed [here](https://github.com/users/MeganRoberts-dev/projects/4)

### Brand and Identity

All decisions were decided as a team 

- The brand name: **404 Sadness Not Found** 
- The app name: **Utime.**
- Our slogan: **Your space, your soundtrack, your UTime.**

#### Logo image 

Our logo was designed in-house with simplicity and sleekness in mind, ensuring it complements rather than distracts from the site's content. This conscious decision aims to keep users immersed in their own environment. Additionally, the design emphasises the words "i" and "me" within the word "Time," cleverly playing on the concept of a user's personal space.
